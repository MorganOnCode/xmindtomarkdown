Convert XMind files to Markdown for Obsidian

To convert a .xmind file format to markdown, you can do the following steps:
 1. Read the .xmind file using a library such as python-xmind or xmind2md.
 2. Parse the .xmind data structure into a more suitable format for markdown, such as a tree structure.
 3. Traverse the tree structure and generate markdown syntax for each node.
 4. Write the generated markdown syntax to a .md file.

See the 'xmindtomd.py' file for the code


To run this code in Visual Studio, follow these steps:
1. Open Visual Studio and create a new Python project.
2. In the Solution Explorer, right-click on your project and select "Add > New Item".
3. Choose "Python File" and give it a name (e.g. "converter.py").
4. Copy and paste the code into the newly created file.
5. Make sure you have the required library "xmind2md" installed in your environment. 

To install it, open the terminal in Visual Studio (View > Terminal) and run the following command:

```pip install xmind2md```

Save the file and press F5 to run the code.
If the code runs successfully, it will generate a .md file in the same directory as the .xmind file, containing the converted markdown content.
Note: You need to have Python and Visual Studio installed on your computer to run this code.
